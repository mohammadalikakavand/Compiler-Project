# Py-minus Compiler Project

Welcome to my Py-minus Compiler Project!

This is a one-pass compiler for a simplified version of Python programming language. The compiler is built to cover the main components of a compiler:

- Scanner
- Parser
- Intermediate code generator
- Semantic analyzer and Final code generator

The project is divided into four programming assignments, each of which focuses on one of the main components. 

1. Design and implement a scanner, which will read the input source code and convert it into a sequence of tokens. 
2. Build a parser, which will analyze the sequence of tokens and build an parse tree. 
3. Generate intermediate code from the parse tree. 
4. Perform semantic analysis on the intermediate code and generate final code. 

All assignments are implemented in Python, and each phase of the compiler can interface with the other phases. The detailed documentation for this project is included in the repository.

Thank you for checking out my Py-minusi Compiler Project!
